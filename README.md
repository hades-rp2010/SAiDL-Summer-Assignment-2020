# SAiDl-Summer-Assignment-2020

This repo contains an attempt to replicate the experiments and results of an ICML Paper titled "Training Binary Neural Networks through learning with noisy supervision". 
A review of the paper and some details of the experiments have been given [here](https://github.com/hades-rp2010/SAiDL-Summer-Assignment-2020/blob/master/Review.pdf).

## Full ResNet experiments

- [X]  CIFAR-10 Notebook
